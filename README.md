👾 MyriFetch

MyriFetch is a modern, high-performance ROM manager and downloader designed specifically for the Myrient (Erista) repository. It replaces manual browser downloads with a sleek, dark-mode GUI capable of browsing, queuing, and accelerating downloads via multi-threading.

✨ Features

🚀 "Hydra" Download Engine: Splits files into 4 parallel chunks (threads) to maximize bandwidth and bypass single-stream speed limits.

🖥️ Visual Browser: Automatically fetches console icons and game metadata for a visual browsing experience.

📦 Bulk Queue System: Select multiple games, add them to the queue, and let it run in the background.

💾 Smart Resume & Integrity: Checks file sizes and stitches parts automatically. Includes a "Cancel" feature for safe stopping.

🐧 Cross-Platform: Runs natively on Windows (.exe) and Linux (.AppImage).

🎨 Modern UI: Built with CustomTkinter for a clean, dark-themed interface.
